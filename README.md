# Smart-Predictive-Modeling-for-Rental-Property-Prices

This project aims to predict rental prices based on historical data and property features, following a comprehensive approach:

## Data Preprocessing:

* Clean and preprocess historical rental prices and feature data.
* Handle missing values through imputation techniques.
* Identify and address outliers using appropriate methods.
* Encode categorical variables for compatibility with chosen models.
  
## Feature Selection and Engineering:

* Analyze feature importance to identify influential factors for rental prices.
* Engineer new informative features based on domain knowledge and data exploration (e.g., proximity scores to amenities, neighborhood characteristics).

## Model Selection:

In my results some of the columns not having that correlation with target variable so thats why I go with tree based model of **RandomForestRegressor**

## Model Training and Evaluation:

* Split the data into training and testing sets.
* Train the selected models on the training data.
* Evaluate model performance on the testing set using metrics like mean squared error.
  
## Hyperparameter Tuning:

* Fine-tune model hyperparameters (grid search, random search) to optimize prediction accuracy got reduced in my case because of some parameters makes my model to learn 100 percent in that case some noise got generated with that score got reduced or In some cases there might be chance of missing any important parameter that we are not taken in tuning even that is also second case to reduce model performance.
  
## Interpretability and Explainability:

* Analyze feature importance to understand key factors influencing predicted rental prices.
* Provide insights into how specific features impact the final prediction.
  
## Deployment:

* Deploy the best-performing model as a user-friendly streamlit API, allowing users to input property details and receive rental price predictions.

## Conclusion:

This project utilizes several steps to develop a robust and accurate rental price prediction model. By addressing data quality, selecting relevant features, and choosing appropriate models, we aim to provide valuable insights to stakeholders involved in the rental market. This model can be further enhanced by incorporating additional features, exploring more advanced models, and continuously monitoring its performance in real-world scenarios.
